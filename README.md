# Air Quality Analysis 

This repository consists of an air quality analysis performed on the 'Air Quality' dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository]("archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality").

The algorithm used is Support Vector Regression.

# Installation

For running the project I recommend creating a virtual environment even though the libraries used are pretty common.
